# TCG-Python-Odds-Calculator
This small project was born as a simple self-assignment, with which I tried to use Python (mostly scipy.stats) to recreate a "Trading Card Game odds calculator", by which I mean an instrument with which to calculate the probability of drawing any amount of copies of a certain card, or a combination of cards, from a deck.
